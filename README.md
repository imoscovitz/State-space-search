Uniform cost, greedy best first, and A* implementations

Implements three graph search algorithms -- uniform cost (optimal, a generalized version of Dijkstra), greedy best first (informed, heuristic-based), and A* (heuristic-based and, under certain assumptions, optimal).

Sample problem is to find optimal route from start-to-goal in a map of France.
